## üåü About
This project implements a **Naive Bayes-based OCR System** that recognizes handwritten digits (2 and 4). The goal is to process images, extract features, and predict digits based on pixel values. It‚Äôs a simple yet effective application of machine learning techniques to solve Optical Character Recognition tasks.

## üöÄ How It Works
The OCR system processes images of handwritten digits, extracts pixel data, and applies the **Naive Bayes classifier** to predict the digit in the image. By analyzing the probability of pixels being part of specific digits, the model classifies the image based on the highest likelihood.

### Key Features:
- **Image Preprocessing**: Converts raw pixel data into feature vectors suitable for classification.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: A powerful algorithm that leverages Bayes' Theorem to classify images based on pixel likelihoods.
- **Data Handling**: Handles both training and test data by splitting based on classes (2 and 4), and calculates class and feature probabilities.

## üìä Model Evaluation
After training, the model's performance is evaluated based on:
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) values.
- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model on the test dataset.
- **Classwise Accuracy**: Evaluates how well the model predicts each digit class (2 and 4).

## üí° Why Naive Bayes Works Well for OCR
Naive Bayes is particularly suited for OCR tasks due to its ability to handle:
- **Feature Independence**: Each pixel is considered independently, making it computationally efficient for high-dimensional data.
- **Small Training Data**: Even with limited training data, Naive Bayes performs effectively, which is useful for OCR where labeled data might be sparse.

### Limitations of Naive Bayes in OCR:
While Naive Bayes excels in simple cases, it may struggle with more complex features or where the relationships between pixels are not independent (e.g., continuous data such as house prices).

## üöß Future Improvements
- **Advanced Techniques**: Experiment with **deep learning models** such as **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for more accurate and scalable OCR solutions.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Enhance the model‚Äôs performance by tuning hyperparameters and experimenting with different machine learning algorithms.
- **Real-Time OCR**: Develop a **real-time OCR system** for applications like document scanning and live text recognition.

## üìù Notebook Overview
In this notebook, we implement the core logic of the **Naive Bayes OCR System**. The steps followed are:
1. **Preprocessing the Image**: Convert raw pixel data into arrays and images for model input.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract pixel probabilities for the Naive Bayes model.
3. **Training the Model**: Train the Naive Bayes classifier on labeled images of handwritten digits.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Calculate accuracy, confusion matrix, and class-wise accuracy for evaluating model performance.
